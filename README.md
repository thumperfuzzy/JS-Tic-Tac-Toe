# JS-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe programmed in JavaScript

This is a project I've been thinkin about doing for a while to try to get better at programming concepts and javascript. I know that many others probably have already done this and have done it better, but I still wanted to make it.

To run the program, clone the repository and run the html file in any browser that supports the canvas element, which is most modern browsers.

	To Do:

	~~make the x's and o's actually appear when you click~~
	~~program the game logic~~
	add this to my github website (thumperfuzzy.github.io)
	make the website more visually interresting
	other assorted things that will pop up
	fix various future bugs
