# JS-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe programmed in JavaScript

This is a project I've been thinkin about doing for a while to try to get better at programming concepts and javascript. I know that many others probably have already done this and have done it better, but I still wanted to make it.

To run the program, clone the repository and run the html file in any browser that supports the canvas element, which is most modern browsers.

You can also just download all of the files and run the html file, or it is now on thumperfuzzy.github.io
